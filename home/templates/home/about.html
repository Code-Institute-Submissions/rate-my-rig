  <p class="text-justify">
      So why would it make more sense to build your own computer as opposed to picking up a pre-built one? With desktop computer sales at an all-time low and 
      an endless range of laptop configurations available for consumers to choose from, the thought of assembling your own PC from scratch might seem like a rather 
      dated concept relevant only to die-hard enthusiasts. However, contrary to popular belief, the desktop remains the preferred machine when it comes to power, 
      productivity or even value for money. to read more the benefits of assembling your own pc please click
